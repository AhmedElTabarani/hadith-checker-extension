# Hadith Checker Extension

A browser extension through which you can verify whether Hadiths are authentic or fabricated

This extension was mainly designed for the Arabic language because it was relay on dorar.net website which is an Arabic website for hadiths
After a while, I discovered the sunnah.com site which has English translations for hadith so I decided to rely on it for the English language

> [!NOTE]
> Right now there is only one tab you can benefit from, which is the `Search In Sunnah Site With English Translation` tab
> UI not translated to English yet [Issue 33: Add i18n](https://github.com/AhmedElTabarani/hadith-checker-extension/issues/33)

## Hadith Origins Feature

You can explore the origins and sources of any hadith by clicking the `أصول الحديث` (Hadith Origins) button.

This feature provides:

- **Multiple Sources**: View all different sources that narrated the same hadith
- **Chain Variations**: Compare different chains of narration (isnad)
- **Source Analysis**: Understand how the hadith was transmitted through various collections

This helps researchers and students of hadith to:

- Verify the authenticity through multiple sources
- Study the variations in narration
- Understand the historical transmission of the hadith
